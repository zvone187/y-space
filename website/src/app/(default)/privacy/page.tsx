            <h2 className="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-white">Overview</h2>
            <p>
              Y Space mobile is a companion for a Y Space desktop app that you control. It does not
              run product analytics or third-party crash reporting in mobile sessions, show ads, or
              sell personal information. This policy also explains the limited services used by the
              Y Space website and optional push notifications.
            </p>

          <section>
            <h2 className="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-white">Data handled by the app</h2>
            <p>
              When you pair a desktop, the app stores connection details such as the desktop name
              and identifier, endpoint, access token, and your mobile preferences. It also receives
              and caches the projects, threads, terminal output, files, and settings that your
              paired desktop makes available. This data is used to provide the features you request.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-white">Camera and QR scanning</h2>
            <p>
              Camera access is optional and is used only to scan a pairing QR code. Video frames are
              decoded on your device. Y Space does not record, store, or upload camera images or
              video. You can pair by entering the endpoint and token instead.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-white">
              Desktop connections and storage
            </h2>
            <div className="space-y-3">
              <p>
                App requests and live updates travel between your device and the paired desktop.
                Native builds keep pairing credentials in the operating system&apos;s secure
                storage; the web app uses encrypted browser storage when supported. Removing a
                paired desktop deletes its saved connection data from the app.
              </p>
              <p>
                Connections can use HTTPS or, in native builds, HTTP on a trusted local network.
                HTTPS encrypts data in transit; plain HTTP does not. Only use an HTTP endpoint on a
                network you trust.
              </p>
            </div>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-white">Optional push notifications</h2>
            <p>
              If you enable notifications, the native app receives an Apple Push Notification
              service (APNs) or Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) token; an installed web app creates a
              browser Push API subscription. The app sends that registration to your paired desktop.
              The desktop may send the registration and notification content through Y Space&apos;s
              hosted service, which forwards the message to APNs, FCM, or the browser push service.
              Notification content can include a project or thread name and status needed to show
              the alert; desktop privacy settings can redact identifying titles. Apple, Google,
              Mozilla, Microsoft, and Y Space&apos;s hosting provider may process delivery data
              under their own terms. You can disable notifications or remove the paired desktop to
              unregister the device.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-white">Website analytics</h2>
            <p>
              The public Y Space website uses Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights to understand
              aggregate site usage and performance. These website services are separate from the
              mobile companion session, where product analytics and remote diagnostics are disabled.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-white">Sharing and retention</h2>
            <div className="space-y-3">
              <p>
                Y Space does not sell or rent mobile data or use it for advertising. Data is shared
                only when needed to connect to services you choose through the paired desktop, to
                deliver optional notifications, to operate the website, or when required by law.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pairing data and cached content remain on your device until you remove the desktop
                or clear the app&apos;s data. Push registrations remain on the paired desktop until
                they are unregistered or removed. Hosting and notification providers may retain
                operational or security logs according to their policies.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you email support or open a GitHub issue, Y Space receives the information you
                choose to provide and uses it to investigate the request and respond.
              </p>
            </div>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-white">Security and children</h2>
            <p>
              Y Space uses access tokens and platform security features to protect connections and
              stored credentials, but no system is completely secure. Y Space is a developer tool
              and is not directed to children under 13.

            <p>
