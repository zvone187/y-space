 *  - **Version bump** — `current` moved past the version the user last
 *    acknowledged. The badge lights up the moment they update, even before the
 *    notes for `current` have been published. This is the common case.
 *  - **Late content** — the user already acknowledged `current`, but a release
 *    note at or below `current` is newer than anything they have actually seen
 *    (its publish lagged the binary). The badge returns so they do not miss it.
 *
 * Notes for versions newer than `current` (a release announced before its build
 * ships) are intentionally ignored, so pushing the changelog early is harmless.
 *
 * `lastSeen` tracks the newest content seen; `acknowledged` tracks the version
 * the user last dismissed at. Both are null only on a not-yet-initialized
 * profile, where there is nothing to announce.
