/**
 * Per-(project, worktree) working state for the git review panel: in-progress
 * drafts (commit message, PR title/body/target) and the in-flight flags for
 * every async action the panel can run (generate, commit, sync, merge, pull,
 * create PR).
 *
 * Lives in a module-level store — NOT component `useState` — so it survives
 * the panel unmounting and remounting when the user switches projects. The
 * panel is keyed by `${projectId}:${worktreePath}` (see AppOverlays /
 * GitReviewPanelContent), so switching away and back fully remounts the
 * subtree; local state there would reset to empty. Because every action
 * (commit, push, merge, and especially the long-running generate/PR-summary
 * supervisor calls) keeps running across that remount, its pending flag and
 * any result must live somewhere that outlives the component. Routing all of
 * it through this store — keyed by the same `storeKey` the panel uses
 * (`statusKey ?? project.id`) — means spinners reappear on return and async
 * results land against the right panel even if it unmounted mid-flight,
 * instead of resolving into a dead component instance.
 *
 * Intentionally in-memory only (no localStorage): an in-flight flag must not
 * survive an app restart, or an action killed with the process would leave its
 * spinner stuck on forever.

 * branch). `text` is the exact generated string, matched against the final

 * controls maps to a phase, so the slot doubles as the panel's mutual-exclusion
