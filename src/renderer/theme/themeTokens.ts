/**
 * Theme token derivation.
 *
 * A theme preset is authored as a handful of anchor colors (`ThemeSpec`); the
 * full set of app CSS custom properties is derived from them here via
 * `color-mix` so palettes stay internally consistent and cheap to author. The
 * derived values intentionally mirror the relationships baked into the base
 * theme in `styles.css` (secondary/tertiary surfaces step toward the
 * foreground, the scrollbar is a translucent muted, etc.).
 *
 * Authoring anchors in plain hex (the canonical color each editor theme ships)
 * keeps the catalog faithful to the upstream themes; only layout-neutral color
 * tokens are themed, so radius, spacing, fonts, and semantic status colors
 * (success/warning/danger) stay on the base values.

 * ~2.3:1 on its background). The blend is pushed only as far as needed to clear
 * a WCAG contrast floor, so muted stays recessive while matching the base
 * Y Space theme's readability (~4.5–6:1) for every palette, and still
 * inherits each theme's tint because `fg` / `bg` are themed.
 *
 * The strict floor applies to the content background (where settings
 * descriptions and primary body copy sit); panels (surface) and the sidebar
 * get a relaxed floor so muted lands dimmer there — keeping a clear visual gap
 * from the active foreground without over-brightening it.
