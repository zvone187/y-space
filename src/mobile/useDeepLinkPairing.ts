/**
 * Universal Links: a deployment-owned pairing link (`https://pair.example/pair?host=…#token=…`)
 * opens the installed app through the associated-domains entitlement instead of
 * the hosted PWA. Capacitor's App plugin delivers the tapped URL — on a cold
 * start via `getLaunchUrl()`, and while the app is already running via the
 * `appUrlOpen` event.
 *
 * Pairing is NEVER completed here: a tapped link carries an attacker-chosen
 * `host`, so binding to it silently would let one tap pair the device to a
 * malicious endpoint. Instead the offer is routed to the /desktops screen with
 * the endpoint + token prefilled, where the user must confirm (tap "Pair",
 * seeing the target host). This mirrors the PWA boot path, whose launch params
 * `capturePairingLaunch()` reads from `window.location`.
